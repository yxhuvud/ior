# ior
Bindings for liburing. These bindings are not intended to be safe,
or to replace the built-in ways of doing IO in Crystal. Rather this
is intended to be the base for other libraries and applications use
so that they can accomplish that.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     ior:
       github: your-github-user/ior
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "ior"
